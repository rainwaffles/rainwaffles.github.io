## Making a Website
Is everyone expected to have a website now? I never really felt the desire to create a website from scratch, yet I can't help but feel bad for using this beautiful template I found online (the template is called Massively for Jekyll).

At first when making this website I felt annoyed that software engineers and computer scientists are expected to know pretty much everything to be any good. But I realized two things: first, that I had been placing unfair expectations on myself (and on programmers as a whole), and second, that being forced to learn a bit of everything is great. I can't even recall the number of times I have trawled through the internet (and a fair portion of Wikipedia) on a hunt to find out how to accomplish
something fairly innocuous in Arch Linux. Every time I do so, I get a glimpse at the complexity of computers and uncover a bit of extra knowledge that might help me later down the line.

Contrast this to a Unix Administration class I recently started taking: without the help of online resources to consult for answers, all the fun of uncovering how to do something in Unix was lost, and using the command line just became another boring excercise in memorization. That class is now one of my least favorite of all time.

Thankfully web development has so far been more exciting than it has been tedious. Let's hope it stays that way.
